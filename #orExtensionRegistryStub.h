! A simple stub which does nothing.  Do not add extensions here.
! We do a little magic with this file, and paths, to address the lack of an optional include 
! directive.  To use personal extensions, create your own folder, add your framework compliant
! extensions to it, and add a file named "#orExtensionRegistryStub.h" to that folder.  Then
! ensure that folder is listed *before* the orLibrary path in the include_path setting.
